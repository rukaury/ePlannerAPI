# ePlanner REST API
API used for the ePlanner system (QR code reader and TicketViewer). The API should allow users to list or add necessary information regarding events, tickets and guests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The API is built using a small python-based framework called Flask, therefore will require python to be installed.

### Installing

Once python is installed, a virtual environment can be used for development. 

These steps can be used to install a virtual environment: 

1. Install a virtual environment (Mac OS X): `sudo easy_install virtualenv` 

2. Activate the environment by running: `venv/Scripts/activate`

Creating a virtual environment for each application ensures that applications have access to only the packages that they use.
