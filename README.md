# ePlanner

ePlanner (event planner) is an event ticketing system which allows users to send an invitation to guests and if they accept, a ticket with a QR code will be sent to them and will be scanned using a mobile app once they arrive at the event. If they do not accept, a ticket will still be created for them but with a declined status.
